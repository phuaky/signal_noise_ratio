**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ SAFE TO MAKE PUBLIC

## Executive Summary

The repository has been thoroughly scanned for sensitive information. **No secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials were found**. The repository is safe to make public with minor recommendations below.

## Audit Results

### ✅ No Secrets Found

**Checked for:**
- API Keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, etc.)
- Authentication tokens
- Passwords
- Private keys
- OAuth credentials
- Webhook URLs

**Result:** None found in code or git history

### ⚠️ Personal Information Found (Minor)

**Found:**
1. GitHub username "phuaky" in:
   - `.git/config` (repository URL)
   - Git history

2. Local paths with username "pky" in:
   - Test files and documentation
   - Example commands

**Risk Level:** LOW - These are typical in open source projects

### ✅ Configuration Files

**`.env` file contents (server/.env):**
```
PORT=3001
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
CORS_ORIGIN=chrome-extension://*
```
**Status:** Safe - Only contains local development settings

### ✅ Git History

- Only 2 commits in history
- No sensitive data in previous commits
- No accidentally committed secrets that were later removed

## Recommendations Before Going Public

### 1. Update Personal References (Optional)

Replace personal paths in documentation:
```bash
# Change from:
/Users/pky/Code/signal_noise_ratio

# To generic:
/path/to/signal_noise_ratio
# Or:
~/signal_noise_ratio
```

**Files to update:**
- `docs/TESTING_REPORT.md`
- `docs/EXTENSION_TEST_GUIDE.md`
- `tests/diagnostic.js`
- `tests/test-ai-analysis.sh`
- `tests/test-extension.js`

### 2. Add Security Files

Create these files before going public:

**LICENSE** (if not present):
```
MIT License
Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name]
```

**SECURITY.md**:
```markdown
# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities to [your-email] 
Do not create public issues for security problems.
```

### 3. Update README

Add badges and links:
- License badge
- Version badge
- Link to issues/discussions

### 4. Review .gitignore

Current `.gitignore` properly excludes:
- ✅ node_modules
- ✅ .env files
- ✅ Logs
- ✅ IDE files

## Files Safe for Public Release

### Core Extension Files
- ✅ All JavaScript files (no hardcoded secrets)
- ✅ HTML/CSS files
- ✅ Manifest.json (no sensitive permissions)

### Server Files
- ✅ Express server code
- ✅ Ollama integration (local only)
- ✅ Test files

### Documentation
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ CLAUDE.md
- ✅ All docs/ files

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All API keys must be provided by users
2. **Local Storage Only**: Extension uses Chrome's secure storage
3. **No External Tracking**: No analytics or telemetry
4. **CORS Properly Configured**: Only allows extension and localhost
5. **No Remote Code Execution**: All code is bundled locally

## Final Checklist

- [x] No API keys in code
- [x] No passwords or secrets
- [x] No private credentials
- [x] No sensitive URLs
- [x] .env file safe (local config only)
- [x] Git history clean
- [ ] Personal paths in docs (optional to fix)
- [ ] LICENSE file added
- [ ] SECURITY.md added

## Conclusion

**The repository is SAFE to make public.** The only findings are minor personal references (username in paths) which are common in open source projects and pose no security risk.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Optionally update personal paths to generic ones
2. Add LICENSE file
3. Make repository public on GitHub
